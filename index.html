<p>For this first assignment I chose the sixth and last poem from the given list.
In this composition I tried to represent the frantic flight of the albatross above the “pelagic vastness of the night”. 
The bassoon is miming her sad and lonely thoughts, her regrets. The background pulse recreates the movement of the wings, that becomes faster as the albatross approaches and comes to the conclusion of her thoughts.
At the end the echoes of the silence in the “plundered womb”.</p>



<h2>Assignment 2 - Dance of the Light Interpretation</h2>



<p>For this second assignment, I decided to just watch the video several times and, only when I was ready, to interpretate it with the sounds music. Then I sat down in front of my keyboard and started to play whatever came into mind.
It is a very minimalistic composition, but I thought it wasn’t necessary to add instruments or effects.
I wanted to recreate a conversation between the lights, a story of movements and colours.</p>
