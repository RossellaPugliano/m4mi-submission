<p>For this first assignment I chose the sixth and last poem from the given list.</p>
<p>In this composition I tried to represent the frantic flight of the albatross above the “pelagic vastness of the night”.</p>
<p>The bassoon is miming her sad and lonely thoughts, her regrets.</p>
<p>The background pulse recreates the movement of the wings, that becomes faster as the albatross approaches and comes to the conclusion of her thoughts.</p>
<p>At the end the echoes of the silence in the “plundered womb”.</p>



<h2>Assignment 2 - Dance of the Light Interpretation</h2>



<p>For this second assignment, I decided to just watch the video several times and, only when I was ready, to interpretate it with the sounds music.</p>
<p>Then I sat down in front of my keyboard and started to play whatever came into mind.</p>
<p>It is a very minimalistic composition, but I thought it wasn’t necessary to add instruments or effects.</p>
<p>I wanted to recreate a conversation between the lights, a story of movements and colours.</p>



<h2>Assignment 3 - Short Film</h2>

<p>For this assignment I chose the video “Erased”, which is the one that I probably liked the most.</p>
<p>I used some synths to recreate the sweet and dreamy atmosphere but also the undertones that characterise the worrying feeling.</p>



<h2>Assignment 4 - Game</h2>

<p>Probably the assignments I enjoyed doing the most.</p>
<p>“Vanquisher” is a card game with a medieval background and it is with this idea that I started to create the music.</p>
<p>Harp, violins and drums create a simple but effective medieval style, very popular in games.</p>
<p>Some sound effects accompany the game moves.</p>
<p>I decided to be simple and minimalistic with the effects, so the player would not be overwhelmed by them when playing.</p>
